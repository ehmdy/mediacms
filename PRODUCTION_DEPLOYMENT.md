## Deployment Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mediacms
   
   # Set environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with production values
   ```

2. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Check service status
   docker-compose ps
   
   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

3. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create admin user
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   
   # Collect static files
   docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   ```

## Verification

The system automatically processes uploaded videos through the following pipeline:

1. **Upload Detection** - New videos trigger `media_init()`
2. **Track Analysis** - MKV tracks detected and stored in database
3. **Encoding** - 480p and 720p versions created
4. **HLS Generation** - Streaming files created with multi-track support
5. **Player Ready** - Video available with audio/subtitle switching

## Monitoring

- Check Celery worker status: `docker-compose exec web celery -A cms status`
- Monitor encoding progress: Check admin panel or database
- View system logs: `docker-compose logs`

## Support
